**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Coming in I feel pretty comfortable in git with the exception of requesting the version of git and resovling conflicts.


**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
Drilling in the process by which different branches are created and merged felt very helpful. Though I'd previously used git for pushing personal projects a bit it always felt a bit unnatural. Now, because of the repetition here, including in the work for the GPS session, I'm feeling more comfortable doing so.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
None. I had connection problems and failed to be able to stay long enough to do the work with them. 


**What still confuses you about git?**
I could use more practice resolving conflicts and making pull requests from other people's repos. Given how I've adjusted to using other git commands, this too just seems like it's a matter of practice.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
N/A. My session crashed before we could really get working.
